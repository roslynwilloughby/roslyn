			<h1>Bio </h1>
			<p class="lede"> Hi there! I'm Roslyn, a psychology major at Washington State University. My educational path has been quite a journey, marked by transitions between schools and changing my major quite a few times. Despite these shifts, my commitment to my vision has never wavered. I have a unique approach to learning, where I integrate diverse fields of interest including psychology, nutrition, and education, all underpinned by a strong foundation in data analytics and research.</p>

		     <p></p> I'm currently involved in several exciting projects, one of which focuses on bridging the gap between curiosity and learning in children, especially those who haven't had access to education and been able to explore their passions. This project is particularly close to my heart as it combines my passion for psychology and education. Let's learn and grow together! </p></p>
